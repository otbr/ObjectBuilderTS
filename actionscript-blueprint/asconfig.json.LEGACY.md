# asconfig.json - LEGACY CONFIGURATION

⚠️ **This file is kept for reference only.**

The ActionScript source code has been moved to `actionscript-blueprint/`.

This project is now built with TypeScript. See `package.json` for build scripts.

The `asconfig.json` file has been updated to point to the new `actionscript-blueprint/` location, but it is no longer used for building the application.
